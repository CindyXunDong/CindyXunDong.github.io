Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
I worked on reading concepts of image classification as well as sample codes that Lauren shared with me (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/01/build-image-classification-model-10-minutes/). I also found my dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification/kernels) and added another folder of data for food waste images. 
I learned to organize images into different folders. In addition, I learned three different ways to import my data into my program. Firstly, I can type in the path of my image files just like what I will have to do for creating a GitHub repo. Moreover, I can upload my images onto my Google drive and write codes to get my programs access to my drive. Lastly, I can extract a zip file of all of my images from my computer. I decide to use the third method so far, but will try the other ones if I get stuck.
Since I don't need the recycle garbage category to be so detailed, I want to group the cardboard, glass, metal and paper folders into one big recycle folder. However, this folder will contain significantly more images than other folders and it may be hard for the computer to classify. 
I will read my images into my computer and organize my data into different folders using codes for tomorrow. If I have extra time, I will start training my model.
